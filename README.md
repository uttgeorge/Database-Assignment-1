# Database Assignment 1
# Abstract
The purpose of this project is to obtain NBA data from internet, clean and audit them, and build a conceptual database based on these information. This database will allow us to search the biography of NBA players from 2017-2018 regular season, whilst reaching their personal performances, salaries, and team performances.  

# Introduction
### Data are from three different sources:\
**1.Data Downloaded**\
The raw data is [NBA Players' Salary of Season17-18](https://www.kaggle.com/koki25ando/nba-season1718-salary). It is downloaded directly from Kaggle.com published by [Koki Ando](https://www.kaggle.com/koki25ando). This dataset include players' names, team abbreviations and salaries.\
It is stored in **Data Downloaded/**

**2.Web Scraper**\
The raw data is [2017-2018 NBA Regular Season Stats](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/stats/2018/Averages/All/points/All/desc/1/Regular_Season). It is scraped from RealGM.com. The code is in **[NBA2017-2018scraper.ipynb](https://github.com/INFO6210-Spring19-02/assignment-1-group-qi-jin-dongyu-zhang/blob/master/Web%20Scraper/NBA2017-2018scraper.ipynb)** file. There are explicit explanations in this file.  This dataset include players' names, Teams Abbreviations and 19 attributions of players.\
Both code and csv file are stored in **Web Scraper/**

# Audit and Clean Data
Audit validity/ accuracy ( You must  reformat the data to fit your database schema i.e. Use python to check whether there are any null or duplicates and delete the row with those values, describe about the same in the report.)
Audit completeness (Check if the given data makes sense for your assignment i.e check with real world, describe about the same in the report )
- Audit consistency/uniformity (Compare your dataset with another dataset from a similar domain and note whether the values in your dataset covers the entire possible range when compared to the other dataset or is your dataset limited to a certain columns/range of values, for example : Data of score contains no invalid value, in another word, there is no negative scores, describe about the same in the report.)
